#Diagram Functionality
At this pointThe Diagram function works with a few caveats. the main one is a lack of labeling. this will be updated shortly.
The quality of the lines and points are not fantastic but getting there. there is no key and no ability to have multiple diagrams in one picture.

The first diagram below was a test of multiple features. the main graph is black and is the [1, 3, 5, 7, 11] 2/5 dekany. The [1, 3, 5, 7] Hexany is Highlighted Blue. 
The [1, 5, 9, 11]  Hexany is Highlighted Red and both lines and points will appear semi transparent if not part of the generating dekany. 
And the points of the [1, 3, 9, 11] Hexany will be green but will not generate unless they appear on the Dekany or the ghostly hexany.

I did a lot of Manipulation between that first Diagram and Later ones the remainder of the Diagrams on this page are of the same Structure with different mappings.

That first image is the standard Wilson Lattice. The Diagram is of my Hexany Edge Modulation. The [1, 3, 5, 7] Hexany modulated Flanking the [1, 5, 11, 13] Hexany.

The second image is Kraig Grady's altered Lattice. You can see the better seperation between the 11th and 13th intervals. 
In all Diagrams of this structure the Red lines and points show the Mediant Hexany [1, 5, 11, 13], and the blue, cyan, 
green, yellow, orange, and Magenta lines are the different modulations of the [1, 3, 5, 7] Hexany.

The Above diagram was designed to show the diference between the mediant and the flanking Hexany. you can also clearly see the black lines that are 
part of the structure but appear between the flanking hexanies. It also clearly shows the 4 greyed out points. These are not part of this modulation but are part of 
the multiModulation. 

The Multi modulation essentially is performing multiple flanking modulations on the same Mediant with related but different Flanking Hexanies. Each flanking hexany 
must include the [3, 7] factors not in the mediant but can include any two factors of the Mediant like the [1, 3, 7, 11] or the [3, 5, 7, 13] Hexanies. 
in total all of these modulations only add the four ghost notes.

Last I have a pair of diagrams that are linked. the points are in the same place but different relationships are shown with lines.

I think that the beauty of this mapping speaks for itself.
